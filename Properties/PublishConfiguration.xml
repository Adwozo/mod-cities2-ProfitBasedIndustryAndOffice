### Profit Based Industry And Office

This mod introduces different AI system for industrial and office buildings in the game.

**Key features:**

- Companies make expansion and contraction decisions based on their profit rather than product storage amount.
- Considers material costs.
- Set minimum company headcount to 1/4 of building capacity
- More organic growth of company

**Logic**

The original in game calculation is as follow
- less than 1/4 amount of storage fill with product, increase headcount
- more than 1/2 amount of storage fill will product, decrease headcount
- minimum company headcount is 5

**The mod logic**

- if the profit is larger than the Threshold it will increase headcount and vise versa
- output will fullfield internal demand with no mark up, export and import will have mark up on the price and mark down on the profit
- minimum company headcount to 1/4 of building capacity

**Effect of the mod**

- industrial and office buildings will have more organic growth and contraction
- non profiting company could see decrease headcount
- tax rate could impact company headcount more dramatically (by logic not verify)

This mod may initial cause lag with huge population cities, but the lag will ease off after sometime as the updated calculation are done to most building.

Thanks to @Mimonsi and @Infixo . your code in github help me alot in understand how many of the function works.
And thanks to @Cimplicity for working on the problem together via Office Sales Go!

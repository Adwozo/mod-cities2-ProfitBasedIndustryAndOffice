    # Profit Based Industry And Office
    Feature update will be pause on this mod.
    
    This mod introduces different AI system for industrial and office buildings in the game.

    ## Key features:

    - Companies make expansion and contraction decisions based on their profit rather than product storage amount.
    - Considers material costs.
    - Set minimum company headcount to 1/4 of building capacity
    - Added system to sell company product to internal demand and outside city(graph still dont update as of now)
    - More organic growth of company

    ## Logic

    ### The original in game calculation is as follow

    - less than 1/4 amount of storage fill with product, increase headcount
    - more than 1/2 amount of storage fill will product, decrease headcount
    - minimum company headcount is 5

    ### Issue

    - Office do not sell any of the product

    ### The mod logic

    - if the profit is larger than the Threshold it will increase headcount and vise versa
    - output will fullfield internal demand with no mark up, export and import will have mark up on the price and mark down on the profit
    - minimum company headcount to 1/4 of building capacity

    ## Effect of the mod

    - you will see company headcount go to a slightly lower level than pre economy update
    - traffic will increase
    - non profiting company could see decrease headcount
    - tax rate could impact company headcount more dramatically (by logic not verify)
    - company will now sell product to the global market. (cant do inter city transaction yet)

    ## Future plan

    - investigate the threshold further to generate a balance
    - create a option for user to define the threshold using percentile

    This mod may initial cause lag with huge population cities, but the lag will ease off after sometime as the updated calculation are done to most building.

    Thanks to @Mimonsi and @Infixo . your code in github help me alot in understand how many of the function works.
